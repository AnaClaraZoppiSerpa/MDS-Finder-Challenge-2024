# To-dos
- [ ] copy starter challenge code from GAMDS repo

- [ ] come up with quick explanation for the challenge that abstracts crypto concepts, maybe a diagram?

- [ ] copy setup instructions

- [ ] evaluate if I want my previous slides to be here as well (the intro I gave to Gi and Finger)

- [ ] evaluate if I want my thesis slides to be here as well

- [ ] maybe add their youtube video

- [ ] come up with a way of having people share their results, maybe a .md file on a branch from this repo, or a dedicated folder?

- [ ] add disclaimer about informal competition not peer-reviewed blablabla

- [ ] pinpoint most relevant chapters of my thesis on the Reading Recommendation section

- [ ] say you can try any algorithm you want, not strictly GA, as it's a combinatorial challenge

- [ ] introduce myself and explain why I'm hosting the repo and the competition

- [ ] talk to professor to have him share this with his next students

- [ ] send to my advisors so that they know of it

- [ ] send to other contacts in the cryptography community

- [ ] ask about other crypto forums I could advertise this at

# Intro & goal of this repo

# Previous works

- Original work from 2023 - my master's thesis: https://github.com/AnaClaraZoppiSerpa/diffusion-studies-supporting-codes. Code and thesis PDF available at the repo.
- Project in 2024, by Henrique Finger and Giovana Kerche - their final project for UNICAMP's MO824 (Topics in Combinatorial Optimization): https://github.com/AnaClaraZoppiSerpa/GAMDS. Code, report PDF and slides available at the repo - note: report and slides in portuguese.
  - Latest technique on branch `oldSearch`: https://github.com/AnaClaraZoppiSerpa/GAMDS/tree/oldSearch, but feel free to explore other branches if you'd like.

For brevity, the matrices are not shown in this README, but you can find them in the PDFs present at the owners' repos. The current table is intended to serve as reference for your challenge. Try to find matrices with lower cost! ;)
